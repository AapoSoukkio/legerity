# Legerity

Legerity is a framework for building maintainable automated UI tests with speed for Windows, Android, iOS, and Web applications with C#. It simplifies the development by providing easy-to-use element wrappers for native app controls that allow developers to quickly get up and running with UI tests in no time.

Legerity also provides a best practice page object pattern for building UI tests with a maintainable structure. Together with native app control wrappers, Legerity provides the best experience for building maintainable UI automation with speed.

## Documentation ðŸ“ƒ

If you want to deep dive into the Legerity framework with details on how to use the features, you can browse the [documentation](docs/README.md) for help getting up and running!

## Contributing ðŸš€

Looking to help build Legerity? Take a look through our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). We actively encourage you to jump in and help with any issues!

## Building Legerity

Legerity is built using .NET Standard, taking advantage of the new SDK-style projects.

You can build the solution using Visual Studio with the following workloads installed:

- .NET desktop development
- .NET Core cross-platform development

## Got controls? ðŸ¤”

Do you have a collection of custom controls that you'd like to see added to the Legerity framework? Feel free to drop a feature request into our [work tracker](https://github.com/MADE-Apps/legerity/issues)!

Even better, why not help build out your custom control wrapper elements within the framework and help out the community!

### UI Automation tooling

When contributing to new element wrappers, we recommended using the [Accessibility Insights tool](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/). The tool is capable of inspecting and providing property values for Android, Web, and Windows applications.

Alternatively, you can use the [Inspect.exe tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/inspect-objects) for Windows applications installed with the Windows SDKs. This is not recommended as the tool is considered legacy and can often cause oddities in UI when using.
