# Using the iOS element wrappers

The goal of the platform element wrappers is to provide an easy set of elements that surface up properties and actions of the actual controls within the UI to make it easier for you to write tests that interact with them.

These iOS control wrappers are designed to be used with applications built for the iOS platform.

## Available element wrappers

There are currently no base element wrappers for iOS controls. As we added more iOS element wrappers, we will update the documentation here.
