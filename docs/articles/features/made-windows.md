# Using the MADE.NET Windows element wrappers

The goal of the platform element wrappers is to provide an easy set of elements that surface up properties and actions of the actual controls within the UI to make it easier for you to write tests that interact with them.

These Windows element wrappers are designed to be used with applications built with the [MADE.NET UI Controls](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/) for the Windows platform.

## Available element wrappers
