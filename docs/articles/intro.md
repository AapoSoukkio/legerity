# Legerity

Legerity is a framework for building automated UI tests quickly for Windows, Android, iOS, and Web applications with C#.

We simplify your development by providing easy-to-use element wrappers for native platform controls that allow you to quickly get up and running with UI tests in no time.

We also provide UI test best practice components, such as the page object pattern, for building future-proof UI tests that you can easily maintain.

Together with platform element wrappers, Legerity provides the best experience for you to build maintainable UI automation with speed.

## Why should I use this project?

Do you find it difficult to get started with UI tests? Think that they take too long to build and become unmaintainable?

So did I!

That's where Legerity started, a toolkit on top of Selenium that makes my own UI test development fast and easy. This allows me to spend more time building my applications with confidence that my clients get the best, most tested experience.
